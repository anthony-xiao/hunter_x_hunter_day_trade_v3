# Timezone Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing a "can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes" error when loading market data, specifically in the `_load_market_data_chunk` method.

## Root Cause
The error was occurring in `model_trainer.py` in the `_calculate_realistic_returns_market_based` method (lines 984-985). The issue was:

1. `test_timestamps` was derived from `features_df.index` and could be timezone-naive
2. When `start_time` and `end_time` were calculated from these timestamps, they remained timezone-naive
3. The `load_market_data` method expected timezone-aware datetime objects
4. This caused a comparison error between timezone-naive and timezone-aware datetimes in the database query filtering

## Solution
Added timezone awareness checks and conversion in `model_trainer.py`:

```python
# Get historical market data for the test period
# Ensure timestamps are timezone-aware (UTC) to avoid comparison errors
first_timestamp = test_timestamps[0]
last_timestamp = test_timestamps[-1]

# Convert to timezone-aware if they are timezone-naive
if first_timestamp.tzinfo is None:
    first_timestamp = first_timestamp.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
if last_timestamp.tzinfo is None:
    last_timestamp = last_timestamp.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)

start_time = first_timestamp - timedelta(minutes=5)  # Buffer for entry price
end_time = last_timestamp + timedelta(minutes=30)  # Buffer for exit price
```

## Files Modified
- `ml/model_trainer.py` - Added timezone awareness checks before calling `load_market_data`

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_timezone_fix.py`) that verifies:
1. ✅ Timezone-aware dates work correctly
2. ✅ Timezone-naive dates are properly converted
3. ✅ Model trainer timezone fix works
4. ✅ Main.py style market data loading works
5. ✅ Direct chunk loading works

## Verification
- All 5 timezone tests pass
- Market data loading for AAPL works without errors
- Successfully loaded 4128 records in test
- No more "can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes" errors

## Impact
- ✅ Market data loading now works reliably
- ✅ Model training can proceed without timezone errors
- ✅ Trading system can load historical data for backtesting
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
