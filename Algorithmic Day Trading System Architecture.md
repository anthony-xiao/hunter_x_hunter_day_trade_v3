    list(signals.values()), 
    weights=current_model_weights
)
```


## Component 4: Market Regime Detection

### Goal

### Implementation Approach

**Hidden Markov Models (HMM):**
Implement HMM for regime classification with states representing:

- **Low Volatility/Trending**: Momentum strategies favored
- **High Volatility/Range-bound**: Mean reversion strategies favored
- **Crisis/Panic**: Risk-off mode, minimal position sizing [^16]

**Real-time Regime Features:**

- Cross-asset correlations
- Intraday volatility patterns

**Regime-Adaptive Strategy Selection:**

```python
# Strategy adaptation based on regime
if current_regime == 'trending':
    strategy_weights = {'momentum': 0.7, 'mean_reversion': 0.3}
elif current_regime == 'volatile':
    strategy_weights = {'momentum': 0.3, 'mean_reversion': 0.7}
else:  # crisis
    strategy_weights = {'momentum': 0.1, 'mean_reversion': 0.1}
```


## Component 5: Sector Selection and Rotation Strategy

        # 3. Check risk constraints
        if self.risk_manager.validate_signal(signal, symbol):
            # 4. Calculate position size
            size = self.portfolio_optimizer.calculate_size(signal)
            
            # 5. Execute trade
